# Introduction

Welcome!

If you're reading this, you want to contribute to the Made In Africa project. Awesome! Team Afrify appreciates your interest because your effort will move this project forward!

Developing software is easy when the team is small but becomes increasingly complex as the team size grows. These guidelines enable many developers, including you, to seamlessly contribute to the project. They also make it easier for development leads to manage the project.

We welcome any contributions to this project. Some of the ways in which you can contribute are by improving our documentation, tackling open issues, submitting bugs or suggesting features.

# Ground Rules

Refer to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to learn more about the expected behaviour in our community.

# Your First Contribution

The easiest way to get started with the project is by tackling issues labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.

If this is your first time contributing to open source please read this [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

# Getting Started

## How To Submit A Contribution

1. Create you own fork of the code.
2. Complete the changes in your fork.
3. Test your changes.
4. Open a pull request.

Instructions on setting up and running the project on your machine can be found in the [README](README.md) file.

# How To Report A Bug

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email hello@afrify.org instead.

Examples of security issues:
* I have access to something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to.
* I can disable something for other people.
* If you are unsure whether you've encounted a security issue, just email us at hello@afrify.org.

## Filing Bug Reports

If you encounter a bug in the project, please open an issue. Make sure to include the following information:

* What did you do to trigger this issue?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead?

# How To Suggest A Feature or Enhancement

We welcome all suggestions or ideas on how we can improve this project. The best way to communicate your ideas with the team is by creating an issue that describes the feature you would like to see. Please make sure to include why it's needed and how it should work.

# Code Review Process

* All changes made to this repository must be reviewed before being merged.
* The project leads will review the Pull Requests regularly and you can expect feedback within a week.
* If further action is required after feedback is given, you'll be expected to respond within two weeks. If there is no activity within that period we will likely close the Pull Request.

# Afrify Community and Membership

We welcome all developers interested in joining our community. To find out more about how you can do your part to Afrify the web visit our website.

## Project Leads

# Code, commit message and labeling conventions
We use the following conventions to streamline the contributions we receive.

## Commit message conventions

1. Specify the type of commit in the subject e.g. `FIX`, `FEAT`, `TEST`, `REFACTOR` or `DOCS`.
2. Your commit subject line should not exceed 50 characters.
3. Capitalize your subject line.
4. Use an imperative tone in commit messages.

In most cases the commit subject line will suffice to describe the changes. If you have to add a commit message body, please focus on explaining the `what` and `why` of your changes instead of the `how`.

Examples:
> FEAT: Search by name

> TEST: Update unit tests for search functionality

## Pull Requests

All pull requests should reference the issue being addressed.
Example:
> FEAT:Awesome new feature. Closes #1

## Issue Labeling

If you open an issue, please add a label. If you are unsure of the appropriate label, add the `Miscellaneous` label. The development leads will later review the issues and assign the appropriate label.
